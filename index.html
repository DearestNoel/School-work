        <p>Cremè de la meow meow was establisbhed in the early 2000's the idea came from one of The world's first cat cafe, Cat Flower Garden, opened in Taipei, Taiwan in 1998. As time went on we bgan to branch out all over North America with other cat
          cafes opening up. We enjoy seeing the love for our little friends being spread all over the world for people to come view and spend time with. At first we thought of the idea in college as a way to relax, but quickly decided to open one of
          our
          own. To spread the joy of relaxing and playing with cats while drinking some coffee or just doing our work.</p>
