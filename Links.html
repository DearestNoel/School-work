            <a href="https://www.nekorobi.jp/">Nekorobi</a> is one of Tokyo's oldest cat cafes, Nekorobi is a friendly, relaxed spot to hang out, although it's a lot better when it's not crowded, as there are only eleven resident cats to go around. You'll
            find the usual collection of cat toys, climbing trees, hideaway spots and cardboard boxes, along with low-rise, cat-level seats around the periphery of the room

            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nekocafe1998/"> Cats flower garden</a> The world's first cat café, "Cat Flower Garden", opened its doors in Taipei, Taiwan, in 1998.you never feel like the cats are merely there for your entertainment — this
            is their home, and you are the guest. There are plenty of beds and soft spots for the cats to sleep in, and there are two cat-only compartments for them to escape to when they no longer want contact with humans. If you choose to, you can buy
            them treats at the front desk.
